Stoped maintain just cos original have some sort of english and modification that im used to do doesnt make big difference
if you need something specific just write me in discord 

# ShizuruNotes
An unofficial Android tool application of the game "Princess Connect Re:Dive".  

# Forked for myself just to add english and russian
(was about to add ru first but it would take time to translate while english is somehow usable just with pasting keys and some editing) В основном ориентирован на перевод на англ потому что русские не качают приложения с гитхабов и смысл пропадает

# Part for those as me who dont know anything about coding but want to make changes or make app work
How to make your own apk
just if you somehow find out this fork and want to make apk with en( if original still dont have it) open android studio open File> new > project from version control > git url https://github.com/ugrolol/ShizuruNotes/ clone

then build your apk if you dont need to make any changes build > build bundle/apk > build apk

then there would be popup click locate or you can manually open it your project path\ ShizuruNotes\app\build\outputs\apk\debug so its basically working debug version

# If you want to add another language
folders with languages basically looks like ShizuruNotes\app\src\main\res\values\strings.xml or ShizuruNotes\app\src\main\res\values-en\strings.xml

open default values\strings there should be default pop up on top in adnroid studio that you can use translate editor open it then press add locale add w/e locale you need it would generate xml of that locale and folder

in default strings.xml under key string-array name="setting_language_options" add your languages

also if you want to chill together you may add me on discord UgroPnz#4246
